# Playground XYZ Developer Test

This is a test designed to test the basic web development skills of potential candidates.

## Instructions

Modify the html and complete the CSS and Javascript as you see fit to build a simple image
slider/carousel widget.

You can use the below preview as a visual guide to the completed look and feel however this is not
strictly enforced.

Your submission should include the following functionality:

- Previous and next button functionality with a mouse click.
- Extra image tags added to the HTML should be automatically included in the slider on page refresh
  without having to modify any Javascrpt or CSS code.
- Infinate loop in that pressing next on the last image goes back to the first image and visa-versa.

For bonus points you can choose to any or all of:

- Keyboard arrow control for previous and next
- Auto start and rotate based on a hard coded time value
- Responsive down to 320px screen width and touch enabled
- [Super Powerup]: Source the images from a flicker image bucket

You are encouraged to complete your submission without any libraries and in Vanilla Javascript. It
is acceptable to use modern Javascript features available in Edge 12+, Chrome and Firefox latest.
You can split your code up into as many files as you see appropriate although less is generally good
advice.

## Submission

You can either submit your answer as a GitHub repo under your own account or you can email a .zip
of your source code to Jonathan Mullins <jonathan.mullins@playgroundxyz.com> with your name as the
subject line such as "John Appleseed - Developer Test Submission".

## Grading

We grade your submission on a few key factors:

- Code quality and readability
- Appropriate use of code commenting
- Logical seperation of functionality
